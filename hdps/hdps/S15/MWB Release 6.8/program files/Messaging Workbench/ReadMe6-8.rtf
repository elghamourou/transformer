\par 1. Consistency check gave Standard "Invalid Table ID" error for elements in an NS branch.

\par 3. There was a bug in Data type maintenance that sporadically caused the parent component data type to take on the attributes of one of its child sub}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid10824478  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

as only visible if the parent component was subsequently selected. The problem was caused by tree selection mechanics that didn't handle clicks on the tree expansion/contraction button properly.
\par 4. Archive pkg creation features were not enabled on file menu if profile was initiated by double click.
\par 5. Fixed a bug in reverse engineering that affected auto assignment of data types to fields with VARIES DT in the standard. Formerly if any repetitions of affected segments were present, all of hteir respective V
ARIES fields would be assigned the data type of the first segment encountered in the parse tree.
\par 6. In Derive Specification, if 'Make Implementable' option is selected then force auto usage update regardless of properties setting.
\par 7. Fixed bug in reverse e
ngineering that changed upper level elements usage to required if 'Ex val = Req' option was turned on, child had usage of R, but parse tree had no value. Change is now made under these conditions only if parse tree value is non-nil.
\par 8. Fix bug that caused Local Element def notes entered on desktop memo's from being saved if larger note editor was also active.
\par 9. Word wrap in annotations is no longer imposes hard cr/lf at wrap point. This permits using line wrap without affecting formatting. Similar to the way NotePad works.
\par 10. In Field Add form, max and min cardinality boxes were reversed leading to problems with cardinality assignment.
\par 11. Adjust auto}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid2189417  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid1641412\charrsid1641412 computation of length in both Message Tree and Data Type Tree to account better for NS }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

\par 12. In case where message instance had only a field level value, but the profile called for other required components, the missing required components in the message instance were not reported as an error.
\par 13. Add text highlighting to Message Capture text. When node selected in tree the text value of the node will be highlighted in the message instance text.
\par 14. ACK returned by Validation Server will report the Version of the message being ACKed in the MSH even though the ACK will always actually be formatted as a v2.5 ACK.
\par 15. Consistency Check now woeks for pseudo profiles that don't start with MSH.
\par 16. In reverse engineering in cases where field structure in the library was complex but message instance was primitive there was a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid2189417\charrsid1641412 possibility}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\b0\insrsid1641412\charrsid1641412  of spurious assignment of values to the subcomponents of the reverse engineered spec.
\par 17. In message generation the resent option would leave off the last segment of the last message.
\par 18. Validation server now saves ACK message returned as part of session
\par 19. Make table code validation case insensitive, but issue warning instead of error if case mismatch
\par 20. In validation, MSH.9.3 the Message Structure ID will be populated only if it is populated in the message being validated.
\par 21. Reverse Engineering was failing to pass value of field separator into MSH.1,BHS.1,FHS.1.
\par 22. Moving segment repetition down in tree caused rep indicator to be removed.
\par 23. Moving primary segment }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid2189417\charrsid1641412 repetition}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid1641412\charrsid1641412  down no longer causes exception fault.
\par 24. Fix a problem with Validation ACKS, where senders delimiters were not accurately represented in the ACK.
\par 25. Empty terminal components are removed form ACK messages generated by validation.
\par 26. Fixed problem introduced when fixing length autocalc. Problem was manifested by inability to assign an element a usage of B or W. They automatically reverted to usage of NS with a length of 0.
\par 27. Add capability for HL7 Minimal ACK as an option to Validation.
\par 28. MSH.11 - ProcessingID returned in Validation ACKs will be consistent with client message instance.
\par 29. Validation can now optionally be set to honor MSH.15 and .16 for ACK responses.
\par 30. Fix problem with reverse engineering where selecting the consolidate repeat segs option could allow the process to reference a non-existent tree node. 
\par 31. Fix another issue with unwanted line w}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid2189417 rap characters inserted in text;}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid1641412\charrsid1641412  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid2189417 t}{

\par 32. Add a hidden switch that handles UTF-8 encoding and allows both the XML to retain them while rendering them properly in translation to XSL. Without the hidden option, all non ASCII chars are replaced to prevent MSXML }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

\par 33. If file name of profile contained a '.', the display file name was truncated at that '.' making it look as if the wrong file was opened.
\par 34. Fix Registry Transform XSL for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid2189417\charrsid1641412 changes}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid1641412\charrsid1641412  made to SpecXML in last release. Profile conformance type }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0

\par 1. In Value sets setup, when a CE type element is selected in the value set tree, the Table Values selection list now displays Description=value pairs for CE.2 and.4 just as it does for CE.1 and .3. When a value is selected for a CE.2 element
 however, the description is harvested as the value as opposed to the code. Also when CE.3 or .6 is selected the name of the coding system is displayed in the Table values selection list.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid14561270  }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par 2. After selecting a message from message library, structure field becomes focused. If user presses enter, has same effect as clicking compile button
\par 3. No longer show bogus table message for NS elements.
\par 4. Add Condensed Message Tree View option that does not show NS items in message tree. Reporting has been altered too, so that reports may be based upon the condensed message tree.
\par 5. Align MWB Options form to hide label characters partially displayed on main form.
\par 6. Add new Table OID attribute to Table structure, all display and all maintenance functions.
\par 7. If profile SpecName field is changed, Save automatically invokes SaveAS, and now it will suggest a new name based upon the new Spec name and the Msg/Event/OC concatenated.
\par 8. Fix introduce problem of no warning for discrepant usages when Conformance type changed.
\par 9. Don't flag 'No Library for Comparison' error for OBX.5, MFE.4, or RDT in standard comparison aspect of consistency check.
\par 10. Use MWB Version change as a one time trigger to effect changes to the persistent MWB Directory properties. This permits auto updating directory properties for users who update the MWB version, but want to conserve other MWB settings.
\par 11. Added new MessageNote annotation that displays a message instance fragment at any level of the message hier}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid14561270 ar}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid14561270\charrsid14561270 
chy when tree element is selected. It is a read only annotation, but is accessed via the Annotations Notepad just as others are. SpecXML report has been modified to include it and MWBProf
ile.xsl has been modified to display it. A new set of options has been added to the Options Report tab to turn MessageNote reporting on or off.
\par 12. Fix problem with background generation of reports. They were being generated as quasi rtf as opposed to xml.
 Problem was caused by a newly introduced need to explicitly set plain text in editors used to generate xml (specxml) based messages. This would have affected other areas where these reports were generated, but not on reports tab.
\par 13. Prevent adding a segment group that has just one segment.
\par 14. Prevent deletion of segments/seggrps from seg group if less than 3 elements in seg group.
\par 15. Add HTML Reference attribute to Data types.
\par 16. Correct a problem in data type import that lead to erroneous classification of a data type as complex. Used now required to supply primitive status of DT in ODBC input stream.
\par 17. Add New Data type '-' indicating a field that has been withdrawn from the standard. It is a primitive data type, and serves only as a place holder for the empty content in the segment. Its optionality and usage can only be NS in the MWB.
\par 18. Add Chapter reference to ODBC seg import, and HTML reference to DT import
\par 19. Fix Validation server startup exception caused by no default port defined for Validation. This error may be an artifact of change in Indy library after system crash.
\par 20. Add option to save seg libs directly from ODBC import page.
\par 21. Add new option to Message Generation that turns off auto inclusion of MWB Profile Registry ID in MSH.21 of generated messages.
\par 22. Up Arrow movement in Active library selection form did not advance item selection upward.
\par 23. Add new feature that allows inspection of segment definitions across segment libraries. it also incorporates a segment search function.
\par 24
. Add capability to conserve segment repetitions in segment libraries. There is a new check box on the Seg Library Maintenance for "Conserve Rep Segs" that must be checked in order get them into the library. Seg reps are not recognized as new segs, so can
 
be captured only through the "overwrite existing" or "Replace" Compilation options. Replicate segs are identified with a '_nn' tag concatenated with the mnemonic e.g. OBX_1. It is recommended that Annotations be used to distinguish the purpose of the repl
icate segs. The annotations (Design or Local Element definition suggested) will be visible in new segment selection software.
\par 25. A new button has been added to the "Segment Add" form. It is positioned next to the segment mnemonic window, and has a question
 mark icon on it. This button opens another window that initially displays a tab for each active segment library, a listing of the selected libraries segs, and the tree structure for any selected seg and the seg's annotations. This is currently the only f
o
rm in the MWB where segment repetitions may be selected for addition to the Message Tree. As mentioned above, annotations for the replicates will make selection easier. Other segment libraries may be opened using the file menu. Segments from any of the li
b
raries may be selected by checking them on their respective tab lists. When all of the segments have been checked, they may be selected using the 'Select' button to move them to the 'Selected Segments List'. The selected segments may be ordered using the 
arrow key.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid14561270  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid14561270\charrsid14561270 Click the 'Add Segments' button to add the selected segments to the Message Tree.

\par 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab0\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\insrsid11601282 1. Add new menu item to Maint\\Data type that permits saving a DT Pseudo-profile as a data type library
\par 2. Add ability to create non-standard data types by manipulating components and sub components in tree. Disallows creation of sub-sub components.
\par 3. Fixed another bug with HL7 html lookup that gave "structured storage file" type error.
\par 4. Add new clone seg or seg group feature. New structure is added following existing structure.
\par 5. Modified tools menu to make shorter. Removed no longer needed Batch change options (and tool buttons), created new Clone option (and button) and consolidated tree manipulation options under a sub menu.
\par 6. Add structure check to Msgs Structure library editor; also fix library selection and new library entry bug
\par 7. Add indicators for localized table library in use to library display tool and library lookup.
\par 8. Fix condition in table lookup where selection of last row in list caused grid to jump ahead and select 2 rows ahead. 
\par 9. In table maint fixed condition where inappropriate headers were displayed in table for sorted Description/Code pairs. It showed the header as Table Name/Table ID.
\par 10. In case of overly large example value, message generation will no longer display the <max value length exceeded> placeholder, but the entire value.
\par 11. Message Capture parse tree now handles values with length > 80 properly.
\par 12. View Warnings is now activated on remediation form.
\par 13. Table mismatch message is no longer displayed if a localized table is imported.
\par 14. Profile consistency has demoted RE elements without values to a warning.
\par 15. Profile consistency check now reports illegal implementation of sub-sub components
\par 16. Fixed HAPI segment class generation to handle segment groups
\par 17. Fixed a problem in Table Localization where linkage between a local and master table would not occur if the case of the table names was
n't the same. This basically only affected those localizations that used one master file for part of the process, and another master file for another localization session.
\par 18. Eliminated storage of form location for field add and table display forms in .ini file. Was causing numerous numbered entries into .ini file.
\par 19. Saving profile to zip archive no longer buries it in path folders.
\par 20. HAPI code gen files now save to a ZIP archive following HAPI dir structure from 'ca' down
\par 21. Prevent deletion of last segment in seg group. An empty seg group puts the profile in an inconsistent state and may not be loadable.
\par 22. Fixed bug in XML import causing spurious error messages upon loading and moving mouse over specification attributes. Cause was failure to initialize a comparison spec object.
\par 23. Fixed bug that caused spurious "max cardinality exceeded" message for segments in messages with seg groups.
\par 24. Fixed problem where messages read from a file and sent do not pass ER7 well formedness test
\par 25. Took display of seg grp name in hierarchy out of display on rhs of message tree. Long seg grp names were more annoying than their info value.
\par 26. Allow Tables that only exist in profile to be added to localized table library. They Must however be named prior to saving with profile.
\par 27. Fixed problem where tables using same name but different ID's were not being displayed distinctly in the Table index list. This also had ramifications in table delete.
\par 28. Attempt to open mwb files that have 'read only' attribute set returns a more appropriate error rather than the corrupt file error indicator previously displayed.
\par 29. Table Library edit/enter routine has been modified to allow for duplicate codes in a table.
\par 30. Table library print routine has been fixed to display duplicate elements in tables.
\par 31. Added default Values Repository to Msg gen Options. If a default VR is defined, it will be automatically loaded when the message gen session is started.
\par 32. Fixed bug in Validation that caused a spurious "illegal sub-sub components" error report.
\par 33. Add code to make HL7 shorthand notation outside left margin of tree and data type display of dropped down data types easier to visualize - not partially obscured by surrounding components any longer.
\par 34. Added new validation check: Report discrepancies between data type specified in OBX.2 and MFE.5 and that found in message instance.
\par 35.Fix intermittent problems that were preventing proper discrimination of OBX repetitions used in validation.
\par 36.Fix problem caused by large specification level imp notes. Caused MSXML to error when applying style sheet.
\par 37.OBX validation discrimination will now take into account table assignments for OBX.3.1. If the message instance has a value in OBX.3.1 that is found 
on the reference table, then a match will be recognized that together with the OBX.3.1 can be used to identify the appropriate profile OBX to validate against.
\par 38. Fixed a bug that prevented a user screen query from displaying when message compile determin
ed that the structure qualified for upgrade from HL7 to either Constrainable of Implementable conformance type. This would result in an inexplicable change in conformance type especially if just MSH compiled (would auto set conformance type to Constrainab
le). This may appear as a new feature to users.
\par 39. No longer save Main form state or position - in at least one instance user had save app as full screen, but could note get to parts of the form.
\par 40. Fix problem in seg and seg group cloning where the cloned node would be added to the bottom of the tree root instead of as sibling to cloned element. Problem only occured when cloned node had no sibling following.
\par 41. Fixed a bug that caused reversion form local table lib to Master table lib at conclusion of Validation Server Session. Manual validation from Message Capture tab was not affected.
\par 42. Fixed bug that caused length of all selected elements in batch change mode to be set to 3 regardless of the attribute to be changed.
\par 43. Modified Batch change so that textual changes can be initiated by clicking on a blank area of tree as well as by double click.
\par 44. Fix Table Loc/Const. so that can actually provide a name for a table that exists in profile only with no counterpart in master table lib. Entry of name was allowed, but it wasn't being saved.
\par 45. In validating report document by application of DTD/Schema an error would occur if the user cancelled the operation. Fixed.
\par 46. Modify evaluation of element value required to take into consideration case where field is RE, one component is RE and the other R. Now if the component that has 'R' usage is not valued, but the other is, an error will be flagged.
\par 47. Add capability to automatically track minimum cardinality for elements with replicates. Minimum cardinality is predicated on the number of required replicates.
\par 48. Improve capability to validate distinct profile repetitions. To motivate this capability segments may now have repetitions in the profile. For legacy profiles there is a new menu item that permits th
e user to assign repetition status to associated segments. Message instance segment and field repetition may now be validated against distinct profile counterparts.
\par 49. Selection of Rep node in parse tree after validation always resulted in selection of last rep in parse tree and selection of last rep value in message text 
\par 50. Error log in message validation now includes entire parse tree path to node. Formerly just the segment index was displayed in brackets.
\par 51. Validation now checks to see that distinct required repetitions are present in the message instance.
\par 52. False error condition no longer displayed when a local table identifier e.g. HL70007 is used as an example value and table 0396 referenced.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab0\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\fs22\insrsid11601282 1. Tools menu is now available only when a profile is loaded.
\par 2. Test Message Generation will now report the coding system for external table as defined in the table library. Formerly, it would report the coding system for all tables as 'HL7nnnn'.
\par 3. Added SIU messages to v2.5 message lib. DB had only one message structure and was ill formed.
\par 4. When start a new profile, force return to default seg lib.
\par 5. When pass through port is defined, Ack is returned from pass thru destination not from MWB Validation server.
\par 6. Fixed bug in message generation that raised exception due to misinterpretation of Seg Group identifier.
\par 7. Fixed bug that caused localized table lib to be retained as master table lib when new profile created or loaded.
\par 8. Consistency checker will now ignore standard table reference errors if element is NS
\par 9. Consistency checker will now evaluate lengths for component/subcomp elements for HL7 versions 2.5 and above
\par 10. Fixed bug that prevented saving of values repository with profile
\par 11. It is now possible to copy multiple tables in the Local Table Constraint feature.
\par 12. Add Capability to import constrained table lib from another profile or from a table library.
\par 13. Add capability to remove constrained table library from a profile and replace with master table library.
\par 14. Added new warning to reverse engineering and validation. Warning will now be triggered if the message instances has data for an element at a given level of hierarchy that profile does not have an element for. E.g. if the profile has 3 components for a
 
given field, but the message instance has 4 or more a warning will be issued. At the same time, changed the error indicator for a message instance whose data type is more complex than the corresponding profile element to a warning. Both conditions merit w
arning status since under HL7 construction rules message instances are allowed to carry more data than specified in governing profile. Receiver is to ignore the unexpected data.
\par 15. Added capability to view warning messages in remediation log.
\par 16. Corrected display of table element attributes in Table Localization procedure.
\par 17. Initialize table element dates to 0 (giving a date in 1899) as opposed to now. This distinguishes between those elements that have actually had a date assigned and those that haven't.
\par 18. Adjustments to HL7 lookup primarily intended to handle issues associated with legacy profiles that have no HL7 supplied lookup link currently embedded in the HL7 Segment libraries. The MWB tries to compute a lookup link using available info and seg l
ibraies. This fix handles problems associated with field repetitions.
\par 19. Editing notes in floating edit window now enables profile save button.
\par 20. Fixed validation problem where subcomponent with usage R was flagged as missing value even if field level parent did not have R usage.
\par 21. Fixed problem where discrepancy log was not being cleared between invocations of Validate from message capture page. This caused error in discrepancy and remediation logs to appear repetively multiplied.
\par 22. In validation, fixed problem where message instance occurrence of segment was erroneously flagged as an illegal repetition. Case message instance (MI) has ...IN1,IN1,IN2,IN3..; profile defined \{IN1[IN2,IN3]\}
 - second IN1 in MI was erroneously declared an illegal repetition.
\par 23. Add option to check for ER7 well formedness in Validation.
\par 24. Fix a problem with profile comparison related to comparison of elements in repeating fields under some conditions.
\par 25. Add new feature on the message tree pop-up menu that permits users to view the differences between elements in a comparison profile. Option is only enabled when comparing profiles.
\par 26. Modified automatic length computation algorithm so that lengths of NS items are not factored into parent length.
\par 27. Changed the default URL for MWB updates at HL7
\par 28. VA local tables are no longer looked up in table 0396 and so no longer flag validation errors
\par 29. Fixed a bug that caused erroneous missing required value warning in consistency check
\par 30. Change consistency check algorithm to better catch usage and missing ex value discrepancies
\par 31. Fixed a bug that prevented XML encoded ACKs from being returned and instead returned ER7 encoded ACKs in Validation service
\par 32. Fixed maintenance option that permits definition of a regex library, and exposed method to associate library entries with regex attribute on message definition page via right mouse click.
\par 33. Fix a bug that prevented text search of profile elements from completing.
\par 34. MsgStructs Options - fixed bug that allowed internal library and external text file to get out of sequence. Modified form so that it is no longer necessary to use the Open Store button when editing a structure store.
\par 35. Modified Table print utility mainly so that it will actually print a report. Also fixed a bug that precluded displaying report for single table.
\par 36. Fixed a problem caused by differences in the decimal indicator between {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}Europe{\*\xmlclose} and US. Loading a seg library for editing would report an error because US composed data type lib has floating poin
t data with '.' as separator, while restore utility was expecting ','. Fix normalizes all internal lib data to '.' decimal sep.
\par 37. Fix Validation Server ACK responses; they contained CR/LF seg separators instead of just CR as required.
\par 38. Changed parse algorithm and reports to use seg group name as tag name. Formerly set computed value in name field and parsed new seg group names into description attribute.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab0\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\fs22\insrsid11601282 
1. Put a filter in that removes erroneous child level seg groups from pseudo messages built from seg libs. These were introduced in an earlier version of MWB that didn't filter constituent profiles to eliminate seg groups before compiling into seg lib. Th
e pseudo messages may in turn be used to fix the affected seg libs using edit/overwrite.
\par 2. MWB Now reformats XML message instance after parsing so that it is "pretty printed" in the message capture window. This makes it easier to analyze especially if originally submitted as an unformatted string.
\par 3. Reconcile profile now shows profile file names instead of profile names
\par 4. In change data type fixed bug that made usage always 'R'. It now matches original usage. Similarly length remains same as original. Also reference now conserved and Field Add utility allows entry of reference.
\par 5. Profile reconcilliation was skipping segment that were optional and/or repeating - fixed.
\par 6. Was not peristing 'NoLookup' attribute for local tables
\par 7. In table Localization util, selection of local table elements in general table library tree was sometimes causing fault.
\par 8. SpecXML and related reports were not showing local constrained table lib
\par 9. Remove code that prevented removal of a regex from an element in a profile
\par 10. Add New Maint/Profile option set
\par 11. Add new Maint/Profile/Reconcile Profile Batch option. Permits user to select a batch of profiles to be reconciled against loaded profile or pseudo profile (e.g. segment lib);
\par 12. Add new Maint/Profile option that allows user to update a profile with regex from data type library. Intended primarily to update legacy profiles created before regex feature available.
\par 13. Add new feature to create a seglib from currently loaded profile.
\par 14. Add a new feature that permits saving each mesage received in a validation session as a discrete file. This makes viewing received messages possible prior to concluding a validation session.
\par 15. Add new feature to keep track of some user preferences such as main form sizing an placement, same for message validation and message generation. Preferences are save to the MWB.ini file that is automatically initialized and maintained by the MWB.

\par 16. Validation Server now presents IP's as a list instead of a fixed value. This permits those who have both a local network and a VPN IP to connect.
\par 17. Add new feature that reports absolute node index for element selected in tree. Index is 0 based. Access via right click menu in treeview.
\par 18. Fixed a hole in validation where evaluation was thrown off track in seg groups. Also prevent bogus error message for missing required segments when the parent seg group was not required.
\par 19. Add a new tree menu feature that allows user to specifiy seg lib for HL7 lookups.
\par 20. Fix parsing errors involving empty replicate fields.
\par 21. User can now assign seg library with pointer to html doc for lookup. Previously the html doc pointer was set to the first seg lib in the library. That is still the default, but may now be reassigned by user, and the assignment will persist with t
he profile.
\par 22. In validation, fixed a bug that prevented error message when a non-repeatable field had only one repetition.
\par 23. Validation error log entries now include the segment position in the message instance surrounded by brackets. It is displayed immediately after the element name in the entry.
\par 24. Add option to Message Instance Generation feature that permits saving messages framed in MLLP format to a text file.
\par 24. Segment Library Associations for Message Structure Library and Message Capture/Validation now automatically defaulted for new installs and for legacy systems that have not made the associations.

\par 4. Ex Msg HL7XSD report was showing nested seg groups as part of message model - fixed.
\par 5. Calculated Seg Group names/descriptions changed to use upper case to be consistent with HL7 XML SG  naming convention
\par 6. Permit compound seg group names to use '.' as delimiter in addition to HL7 specified '_' in message capture.
\par 7. In compiling message grammar, modify algorithm that coalesces singleton segs in seg groups, such that the algorithm is not applied if the seggroup is named i.e. has (SG_NAME) as part of grammar).
\par 8. Strip empty tags out of XML before processing
\par 9. Accounting for empty content in HL7 parse tree was out by sync by one sequence too many in some instances.
\par 10. Fixed a bug that cause new seg lib creation to crash in some cases when a constituent profile had a seg group.
\par 11. Validation Server now handles XML message instances
\par 12. Tweeked algorithm that gets IP address for display in Validation to ignore IP's like 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. Such IP's were being selected preferentially on some systems.
\par 13. Fixed a bug that prevented Custom Report feature from working
\par 14. Add Horizontal Scroll bar to Remediation checklist
\par 15. Changed message capture to strip cr/lf from the end of lines.
\par 16. Example values that are legitimately escaped when entered are no longer escaped again in report generation. Example Value
s that are legitimately escaped no longer flag an error in Consistency checker. Checking for improper escapement/inclusion of unescaped delimiters has been enhanced to cover all defined HL7 escape sequences.
\par 17. Fixed TS and DTN regex in v2.4 and 2.5  data type and seg libraires.
\par 18. Changed HL7 XML Message instance to get rid of whitespace around value introduced by pretty-print.
\par 19. Version in Ack reported by Val server now fixed at v2.5

\par 22. Fixed HL7TimeStamp function to account for minutes in tz offset
\par 23. Add Encoding to Validation Service Message Grid.
\par 24. Get Repository Values for message instance now handle XML message instances
\par 25. Bug fixed that prevented removal of ER7 as a profile encoding.
\par 26. Created version of RegistryExport XSL that removes all field reps from SpecXML before creating HL7 COnformance profile. This will be new default. Older version that allows field reps (identified principally by '_rep' field name suffix will be optional
.

\par 28. Remediation list would error out under some circumstances with an index out of range error - fixed.
\par 29. Changes to validation navigation algorithm to better take into account repeating seg groups.
\par 30. Add new property to Table definition - NoLookup. This property currently applies only to tables in constrained table libraries. It is a boolean that signals that no attempt should be made to lookup a value in this
 table, and consequently no "undefined table element" errors should be generated.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs22\insrsid11601282 1. Fix problems related to table lookups in validation. If table valuein profile was not formatted properly validation would not complete. Also if the lookup failed validation would not complete.

\par 2. Added highlight features for unknown table attribute and for unrecognized table element in example value attribute. If an unknown table is entered, highlighted text appears next to the table attribute indicati
ng the problem. If an unknown table element is entered as an example value, the font of the table element is highlighted.
\par 3. Add highlight feature for example value with primitive required elements. The 'Example Value' label for the attribute becomes bold until a value is entered.
\par 4. Add New table type 'Imported' to list in support of v2.6
\par 6. Add capabiity to create values repositories used to create test messages. In conjunction with this, add a new feature that permits generation of messages from randomly
 selectedrepository values. The messages may be stored in a file and/or sent asynschronously via HL7 TCP/IP connection to a server. The HL7 client will also receive/store HL7 acknowledements from the server.
\par 7. Fixed problem with ODBC table file import. Undefined values for attributes such as table name, were causing function to crash.
\par 8. Fixed problem with ER7 message including values for elements whose ancestors were NS.
\par 9. Fixed problem where failure to open MRU list file left cursor as hourglass. It now reverts to default after error message.
\par 10. Selecting a new table file in Maint/Options now takes effect immediately. Formerly had to exit the MWB and restart for chnge to take effect.
\par 11. Modified report edit window to persist font attribute selections during entire session. Will revert to baseline with each new MWB session.
\par 12. Fix a problem that prevented length errors from being reported on validation. Profile consistency check for length errors was unaffected.
\par 13. Fix bug in annotations notebook that caused error to be thrown if deleted a tab, then decided to show all tabs.
\par 14. Added Hidden Internal Review note
\par 15. Add Profile comparison stylesheets and add explanatory text to the header of each specialized comparison xsl. New ones compare elements wit
h differences at the filed level and above. Another does the same, but considers only those principl profile elements that are Required. This later one is especially usefull when the principal profile is from the standard and the comparison profile is a w
orking profile.
\par 16. Users should be directed to change the "Non Breaking Space Chars" attribute to "&#160;" from &#194;&#160;. This together with update to XSL transforms will prevent some xsl translation errors.
\par 17. Now Process all SpecXML variants to replace invalid XML characters with the underscore character '_'. Process uses DCPRe regular expression component.
\par 18. Updated Rexex engine (v3.0)
\par 19. Correct HL7 v2.5 seg lib to contain HL7 Item#
\par 20. Allow propfile consistency Check to operate for BHS and FHS headed messages. Also provide default delimiters where none exist in the profile.
\par 21. Added globa application exception handler. Will handle exceptions that haven't been accounted for previously. Given a map file for the executable, it will also display u
nit/procedure/line number attributes. This will potentially be very helpfull in debugging problems discovered but not easiy reproducable in the field.
\par 22. Added Message Generation capability with support for building a Values repository from message instances as well as manually. As with Validation, generated messages may be sent via MLLP to a socket, and session information collected.
\par 23. Conformance file (seg lib) selection utility did not reposition list selection when moving Right hand side items down list.
\par 24. Rearrange text search form so that search result box will expand with form; facilitates reading long results.
\par 25. Remove stay-on-top characteristic of text search form to make interactive uses easier with MWB.
\par 26. Fixed bug that caused fault if tried to Add an unknown seg to existing message profile.
\par 27. Added horizontal scroll bar to listbox in text search. Makes it possible to read text for very long lines.
\par 28. Added Data type check to consistency report. Modified Data type check report slightly.
\par 29. Made changes to DT2-5.mdf and HL7 2-5.mcf to correct spelling change in XON data type
\par 30. Added fix that changes regex for first component of TS d
ata type where the DT is NM to a regex for an HL7 date format as opposed to regex for NM. The fix also corrects for the bogus TS regex that didn't permit having days of 10 0r 20 and permitted tz offsets of > 12 hrs. The fix is applied automatically as eac
h profile is loaded. Profile must be saved to make change permanent.
\par 31. Changed position of all forms previously designated as positioned as designed to positioned relative to main form center. This prevents form from displaying off screen as may occur because of design platform differences.
\par 32. Corrected all TS and DTM regex in data type libs.
\par 33. Put a correction for TS regex in MWB that corrects the regex for TS in profiles as they are loaded.
\par 34. Discovered that Table index used to quickly load a list o
f tables in lib, was missing some elements. To correct the situation, the MWB will now completely rebuild the index and save it at the start of a table edit session. Table edit will no longer ely on the index stream. Initiating the edit session is somewha
t slower now as it takes time to rebuld the index. The table view form used during profile building will still use the much faster existing Table index.
\par 35. Fixed a bug that caused validation to abend under unusual circumstance (MSH delimiters not appropriate for actual message instance encoding).
\par 36. Element movement and addition of elements to the message tree now activate the save button.
\par 37. Added text scrolling supression option to Maint/Options/ reports tab. Supresses display of text as report is built and apparently may decrease report production time.
\par 38. Fixed bug that caused error message when capture message had been changed and parsed multiple times. The linkage of node between the message tree and the parse tree got out of synch under these circumstances.
\par 39. Added new logic to validation to recognize that an element value may not be required if its parent is not required.
\par 40. The requirement for example values is now distingusished between Reviews and Validation. RE elements are no longer flagged in validation if they don't have example values.
\par 41. Elements that have 'R' usage from field and below but whose parents are RE, C, or CE no longer flag an error on validation or Review if they don't have example values.
\par 42. Fixed a bug that prevented rep
orting missing example values in validation when the message instance had an example value for one component or sub component but not others. Given a=R,B=R (R is usage), F^a where a='' would flag an error. F^a^ where a a was values, but value for b was mi
ssing would flag an error, but F^a where b was missing would not flag an error.
\par 43. Batch Profile generation on the Maint/Options/Msg Struct page now applies the "consolidate seg group" option as defined to the generated profiles.
\par 44. Fixed list item up/down movement on Maint/Ops Misc tab Associated seg libs.
\par 45. Values of the format 'HL7nnnn' will now be accepted as valid table 0396 entries.
\par 46. Added functionality to compare a profile against the standard (or active) segment library definitions during cons
istency check. All newly created profiles (i.e. those that are compiled from scratch in the MWB) will hve a the source seglib conserved for each segment in the lib. When this algorithm is executed against them, they will be compared against the original s
e
g lib (if available). For other segments, that don't have a source generating seglib, they will be compared against the set of active seg libs. Discrepancies show up on the remediation log prefixed with 'STANDARD attribute', where attribute names the spec
ific attribute compared.
\par 
\par For the time being analysts using this feature will want to pay close attention to the active libs and their order, especially when dealing with profiles constructed or derived from those constructed before this update. There will 
probably be an associated  procedure that allows users the ability to frankly assign an exisitig seg lib for comparison as opposed to letting the MWB make the assignment. In any event the remediation report will show the seg lib used in the comparison in 
brackets on the end of each discrepancy report line item.
\par 
\par 47. In a change related to 46 above, the comparison report will now handle field repettions without getting out of sinc. Each repetition in the profile to be compared will be campared to the same field in the comparison spec.
\par 48. Added new MWB option - Initialize and and auto adjust ancestor specified max length. If set, this option will cause the exisitin
g Msg Spec Length Fix to be run when a profile is loaded or compile. This will ensure that the component lengths do not exceed their parents length. Secondly, whenever an element length is changed, its ancestors will be automatically adjusted to increase 
the max length appropriately if necessary. If user attempts to attribute a length less than sum of child specified lengths, the length will be automatically adjusted upward.
\par 49. Fixed a bug that caused Consistency check to abend under some circumstances when a seggrp was either added or removed from a profile.
\par 50. Added capability to use Validation server in a pass through capacity. If a client IP and Port are defined, any message received by the Validation server will be passed on to the client. A county of
 messages passed on and any acknowledgments received is displayed.
\par 51.Fixed a bug that prevented some sements in captured message instance from being evaluated during validation. This was most apparent if the message instance was missing one or more of the segments included in the profile.
\par 52. Fixed a bug in validation that erroneously reported FIXED VALUE errors
\par 53. Fix Validation bug that reported missing required segments when parent seg group was not required
\par 54. Rework SpecXML to handle reports with large volumes of text. Found that XML representation of notes could cause a single line of text to exceed 4k, and consequently cause editipr to truncate the line, causing XML well formedness errors.
\par 55. Added capability to constrain table library specificall
y for profile. The constrained profile library is an integral part of .mwb file. Capability exists to derive from default table library and to add table elements not on default table. SpecXML w Tables shows only the localtable library definition if one ex
sits.
\par 56. Profiles opened with double click on .mwb file are now entered onto the MRU list
\par 57. Withdrawn added as a usage type
\par 58. Added capability to create and Send HL7 2.XML in message generation

\par 1. Fixed SpecXML report bug caused by failing to escape spec name.
\par 2. Added XML well formedness test for raw SpecXML prior to translation. An error message is displayed if not well formed. Previously no error message was reported.
\par 3. Fixed a bug in message generation thru the Maint/OPts Msg Struct tab that precluded generation of the reports. Also added ability to generate .mwb, and generally cleaned up other issues.
\par 4. Data type maintenance - fixed bug in expunge option, remove white spaces from DT mnemonics and names as well as Usage notes. Supply defaults for components when building complex DT.
\par 5. Introduced capability to specify case sensitive/case insensitive (default) Regex evaluation. This feature is available in Data type Lib maint, and can be set as a session param for profile evaluations by right click on the Regex attribute field.
\par 6. Add Text search and replace functions to reports edit menu
\par 7. Added ability to remove ref notes and regex from multiple elements selected in msg tree. Trick is to set attribute to space, then press enter. MWB strips the space, and sets the attribute to "" for all selected nodes.
\par 8. Fixed RCD data type discrepancy.'HL7 data type' component defined to have a data type of ST instead of ID.Fixed in DT and SEG libs.
\par 9. Add capability to print a single table definition as opposed to all tables.
\par 10. Added accounting for field repetition sequence in numeric path display. Impetus was complaint that review notes could not pinpoint reported location when repetitions were involved.
\par 11. Change color of fly over element path indicator in tree view to blue.
\par 12. Fix bug that prevented changing the data type of a field that has no siblings (e.g. set id as first field in new z seg).
\par 13. Add feature to Field Add dialog that permits defaulting the field name to the data type name.
\par 14. Add capability to Add seg description at time of adding new seg
\par 15. Tweeked library segment search to remove some user annoyances.
\par 16. Updated the header of the XSL spec comparison stylesheet
\par 17. Making webbrowser component invisible, so it doesn't interfere with window scrollbar
\par 18. Fix MWBSpecComparison.xsl to accomodate nbs chars and get rif og '?'. 
\par 19. Enhanced MWBSpecComparison.xsl to look account for references, also fixed xsl bug that prevented segment and seg group differences from being exposed.
\par 20. Remove invalid character in set id field of ZMH seg in Vista-HEC Zsegs.mcf. Caused comparison xsl transform to error.
\par 21. Now distinguish between consistency check and message instance validation when assessing missing required element values. Error is reported for validation only if the profile element is required 
and value missing. For consistency check, error is reported if element is either R or RE and value missing.
\par 22. Consistency check will now report U and B as ambiguous usages as well as O when the profile is implementable.
\par 23. Add option to search for message elements and profile parameters in text search feature. can double click on message element text to find location in message tree.
\par 24.Added 2 new comparison report XSl. One eliminates comparison if both elements are NS. The other eliminates comparison if one element in NS and the other is (np). In both cases row of affected elements is grayed out.
\par 25. Updated all XSL to uniformly handle MSXML4 nbsp problem in an improved manner.
\par 26. Fixed bug where multi line Use Case text was being truncated at first CR/LF.
\par 27. Add capability to find and index msg elements based on various attributes e.g find all elements that have usage of 'RE' or all elements that have an example value. This feature is accessed by a right click on the attribute of interest, and present
ed in a list like the Reference list intoduced in last release. Dould clicking on an element in the list will select the corresponding element in the message tree.
\par 28. Fix parsing bug that causes |A|B^C^D|E|F|G to parse as |A|B^C^D|E~F|G
\par 29. Fixed problem that prevented loading profile diagrams after loading a message from the structure library.
\par 30. Fixed bug that prevented detection of Invalid table ID's in consistency check. Also ensure that this error not reported during validation.
\par 31. Improved auto table assign algorythm. Option ensures that table assignment to parent node is inherited by first primitive child node if that node has no other table assignment.
\par 32. **** added hooks for DesignNote and OtherNote, need to add a method that shows all of the notes ( or perhaps a select number of them). See init of udoced.
\par 33. Added capability to support new note types as specified in conformance section for v2.6. New note types for Description, Design, Other in addition to existing MWB note types.
\par 34. Modified e
nlarged notes editior. Formerly a double click on a note attribute in the main screen would bring up an enlarged form in a floating window for editing. This feature has been extended to bring up a multi-tab editor form in the floating window. Each tab exp
o
ses another type of note for a particular element. This is the primary way to get at the new note types for documentation. The multi tab editor may be invoked via the new tools menu option 'Annotations Editor'. Alternatively the Annotation editor can be i
nvoked by double clicking on a notes attribute on the main form. When invoked this way, only the tab for the particular attribute is initially displayed, but the other tabs may be made visible by selecting a tool bar option on the editor window.
\par 35. Added new annotations to SpecXML report.
\par 36. Added Maint option on 'Misc' tab that permits user selection of Annotation Tabs to be exposed in editor. Since some tabs may be invoked by doublr clicking on main screen attributes, and other annotations may not be use
d. the user can control the list of annotation tabs exposed on invokation.
\par 37. Added Spell Check capability to Annotations editor. It is invoked via a tool button on annotations editor form. Options 'Misc' tab permits user selection of language specific di
ctionary. Some dictionaries for older version of Office (95,98) may be available on system, but for later versions software is supplied to load non-office dictionaries for this feature.
\par 38.Added maint option on \lquote Misc\rquote  tab that permits setting wordwrap for all editors. Prior to this wordwrap was default on all MWB editors, which lead to \lquote choppy\rquote 
 lines in reports when the narrower editors such as those on the main page were used. Turning wordwrap off, will guarantee consistency of text display on reports.
\par 39. Added warning to consistency check. Consistency check for non-implementable profiles may be misleading.
\par 40. Fixed bug that reported illegal sub-sub components introduced in v2.3.1 from being reported as having missing reference even though parent element NS.This affected the Consistency check report and the Validation report.
\par 41. Fix display of element path in tree and reports where field repetition paths displayed were erroneous.
\par 42. Corrected segment position display to account for field repetions on message capture status bar.
\par 43. Added new feature for message capture analysis. When validating or reverse engineering, clicking on a primitive element in the Parse tree will select t
he corresponding element in the message tree. Conversely selecting a primitive element in the message tree that has a corresponding Parse tree element, will select the parse tree element. Double clicking in either tree will select the corresponding item i
n the other tree and activate the other tree's tab.
\par 44. Fixed a bug in validation. If profile has a repeating field but the corresponding captured message did not, then the comparison would get out of sequesnce hence making validation erroneous.
\par 45. Add new option to Reverse Engineering - Derived spec may be made Implementable.

\par 1. Discovered that data type was not being conserved with the TMsgElement assign method. Resultant Missing data type attribute in captured message for a field repetions cause ill formed XML in HL7 XML encoding.
\par 2. Fixed HL7TableFile25.mwt. It had 2 tables with ill defined table descriptions (descriptions contained '=' chr) 0227 and 0292 for vaccines, that was causing the table file maint process to crash. 
Also took opportunity to update the VA specific table file to a 2.5 version.
\par 3. Added HL7 Version attribute to Segment libs
\par 4. Fixed a bug that cause Conformance aspect of SpecXML to be reported as escaped XML text. Also fixed another potential problem with unescaped chrs in the spec xml report.
\par 5. View Message characteristics: fixed bug that cut off last chr of MSH version id if no fields beyond MSH.12.
\par 6. Added capability to associate seg libs with an HL7 version. This is done via a new 'Misc' tab on Maint\\
Options. If defined these associations are applied during reverse engineering to ensure that the appropriate segment libraries are used to compile the message profiel.
\par 7. Removed redundant Predicate check in Consistency report.
\par 8. Add check for complex e
xample values. Works well for example values that use a delimeter other than field separator. Otherwise an error may not be detected, and may cause misleading error report. Without this new check however the condition would never be recognized because the
 MWB escapes all example values in running the ER7 report.
\par 9. Add check for VARIES datatype unresolved in profile.
\par 10. Add new check for delimiters in values that catches the use of field separators in values as well (see 8 above).
\par 11. Autoset of conformance optionality operates if set for Repetitions and seggroups as well as fields and segs
\par 12. Change data type now conserves the original notes, HL7 Reference, and example value. Works with field repetitions as well.
\par 13. Added new feature that produces a Refe
rence Index form. The form shows a sorted list of the message reference attributes in alpha order, permitting the user to access message elements by their reference. This will be helpfull for users who record the database reference in the Reference attrib
ute, and sometimes have a need to quickly find the message element associated with a particular db reference.
\par 14. Added capability to clear certain attributes for the entire profile: Reference, Example Value, regex. The Primary anticipated use is to initialize a profile by clearing attributes provided by the segment and data type libraries.
\par 15. Fixed bug that caused example values to be doubley escaped causing the escape characters themselve to be erroneously escaped.
\par 16. Fixed bug that caused loss of profile title after accessing reports tab.
\par 17. Fixed a bug that allowed user to drag/drop components out of a field and eleveate to field level causing an invalid data type and field sequencing corruption.
\par 18. Fixed XML import transform (ImportHL7RegTX.xsl). It wasn't processing segment groups and consequently was mishandling them, causing them to repeat.
\par 19. Added new boolean MWB property "AttsInDTD". If true, the DTD report will include attributes, otherwise it won't. This feature was added specifically to supp
ort the VA's use of the Vitria Businessware IE. Defaulted this property and the "IncludeNSinDTD" property added sometime back to 'true' for initialization.
\par 20.Fixed bug that caused Constants defined on options page to be lost. The bug was related to intro of Regex, which also had problems with saving and deleting values in the grid.
\par 21. Developed a work around for problem of a disparity between the decimal point characters between US and European systems. problem was evidenced in table element add/edit wher
e 2 users were unable to share a .mwt file because of the disparity. Table element dates are stored as a string rep of floating point values. This includes the '.' decimal point. The Euro system was unable to use the US .mwt file because when it tried to 
restore table elements the conversion utility for string to fp format would throw an error when the '.' was encountered. The reverse problem was encountered when the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname country-region}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}US
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} system tried to restore a Euro generated MWT and ran into the ',' decimal point. At this point it appears that only table elements were affected, but the work-around should be broadly applicable if necessary.
\par 22. Fixed several bugs related to Data Linkage, ODBC connectivity and Constants definition.
\par 23. Fixed problem reported where holding an arrow key in the message tree would cause notes from the source node to be spread to all tree nodes visited while key was held down. If the arrow key (up or down) was just pressed once, there was no problem.

\par 24. Add a feature that permits selection of an alternate segment lib when adding a single segment
\par 25. Add a feature that permits selection of an alternate data type lib when adding a single field
\par 26. Rework auto actions taken when Conformance type changed.
\par 27. Swap data type utility now conserves the usage of all affected elements as opposed to changing them all to required.
\par 28. Added new feature that presents a form with list of elements with review notes. Double clicking on alist item will select the message element in the Message tree.
\par 29. Make string search utility case insensitive when searching tables, just as with segments.
\par 30. Made several internal changes to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}Main{\*\xmlclose} and uhl7parserSS in order to support bkg thread processing for validation. Mainly has 
to do with localizing global stringlists e.g. CompareLog and RDFList (8/2/4).
\par 31. Fix Delete Table functionality. Actual deletions were not occurring. 
\par 32. Fixed some quirks with Addition of Segment Groups in message tree.
\par 33. Changed logic of Fixed Value attribute so that it is no longer derived, but reflects user assignment via the checkbox on the Message Definition page. It is now a persistant property of the message element.
\par 34. Added new functionality that permits Importation of Diagrams created outside of the MWB if in BMP or JPG format. Fixed some quirky bugs in the MWB Diagram bench as well.
\par 35. Refresh the abstract message structure field upon initial load. An unusual instance of innapropriate structure corrected by manual refresh was noted. This action seems to correct.
\par 36. Structurally, an NS segment or seg group will now be prefixed with a '[' and a required but not repeating seg group will be indicated with a '\{'; the cardinality will still be 1-1 in the later case and 0-0 in the former.
\par 37. Reverse engineering of messages using RDF,RDT segments will now capture repeating RDT fileds into the profile.
\par 38. Entry of large example values was not working properly, and was not displaying properly in ER7 report. Use of right click on Example value attribute now allows for entry of small or large values and they display properly.
\par 39. Implement Local and Profile vocabularies in Diagram drawing tool.

in building the message.

\par 17. Ensure that report editior is cleared before validation performed.
\par 18. Validation errors reported for specific element; formerly could be reported at parent level under some conditions.
\par 19. Fixed bug that caused error upon renetry to the remediation list under some circumstances
\par 20. Modified Validation algorithm to account for profiles in which field repetitions are expressed.
\par 21. Fixed bug in cardianlity validation.
\par 22. Changed algorithm for automatically marking elements with values from a message capture as required. Previous method marked both capture values and values derived from libraries
 required in the reverse engineering process. This had the effect of introducing required fields that were not meant to be part of the profile.
\par 23. Fixed bug that caused item number param to be replaced with description text upon exiting the item number control.
\par 24. Prevent user ability to edit element labels in tree view
\par 25. Fixed bug that prevented stylesheets from applying correctly reulting in nearly blank reports. Condition was caused by failure to escape the '&' character in XML report output.
\par 26. Enh
ancement added: Upon exiting a parameter with a text component (e.g.Example Value) the component is automatically selected for text entry when navigating through the message tree. So for example, to enter Example value text the user can simply select the 
next element in the tree and begin typing without having to also select the parameter text component.
\par 27. Added feature to Remediation list that allows transport of items to the review report depening on whether or not the item is checked.
\par 28. Added automated profile consistency check feature. Helps to ensure that Profile is complete and well specified.
\par 29. Modified Message instance validation so that the enhaced remediation report form is displayed on the Message Definition tab as opposed to enabling the text report tab.
\par 30. Added new check on example value entry that warns if specified element length is exceeded.
\par 31. Added new features to Msg tree pop-up:
\par  - Count of all nodes in message tree, broken out by type
\par  - Count of all nodes for a message tree element
\par  - Computation of Message tree length broken out by specified length (sum of length params), Conformance length (sum of non-NS lengths) and Message Instance, or actual length (sum of lengths of example values). If length discrepancies are discovered in
 the measurement process, they may be displayed for review/remediation.
\par  - Computation of structure length. Same as message tree length except specific to structure selected in message tree.
\par  - Correct Message specification length. This feature ensures tha
t the lengths specified for child nodes are summed into the parent node for the entire message tree. Note this does not correct the problem where an example value length is larger than specified.
\par  - Correct msg structure specified length. Same as for Message Specification length, but for selected msg tree structure.
\par 32. Mod to Usage check utility to make it more readable.
\par 33. Updated main form so that entry into most fields including notes causes the save button to be enabled.
\par 34. In options/Message structures fixed a bug that made entering a new structure library name difficult if it started with 'HL7'.
\par 35. Made modification so that treats sub-sub components as primitives in tree view. This way can handle situations like embedded date range where using only the first sub-sub component still produces a valid message instance.
\par 36. Simplified procedure for applying batch modifications to message tree elements.
\par 37. Modified Message structure lib to contain event description. This permits much quicker loading of a structure library for message selection. Also facilitates entering user defined events descriptions for user defined messages.
\par 38. Modifed Message structure library to associate a prioritized li
st of segment libraries. This can be used to ensure that when a particular message structure library is selected, the appropriate segment libraries will be used to compile the message structure. Formerly, the user had to make sure that the appropriate seg
ment library was selected before compilation.
\par 39. Added a new process that analyzes a message structure being compiled to determine what the appropriate Conformance Type is, and automatically sets it. This is especially usefull in the case where a fully con
strained segment library is being used. Formerly, initial message structure compilation assumed the lowest common denominator - HL7 conformance type, which would trigger "usage" discrepancy messages when segment libraries with a conformance type of implem
entable or Constrainable were used in the compilation.
\par 40. Fixed a bug that caused problems with saving profiles when data linkages were used.
\par 41. Fixed a bug that caused existing review notes to disappear when editing under some conditions
\par 42. HL7 online doc is now accessable via F1 key when tree element selected
\par 43. Element length and example value fields will now indicate via hilite color when the value's length exceeds whats specified in the length field.
\par 44. Fixed bug that caused erroneous data linkages from table library. Only affected those table elements that were used for linkage to multiple message elements.
\par 45. Fixed report of erroneous usage codes to actually report a usage code error as opposed to a 'Data Type' error.
\par 46. Changed usage code discrepancy search algorithm to ignore children of elements with usage of NS.
\par 47. Fixed autoset of optionality for conformance type so that it automatically assigns RE to segs/seg grps that are optional.
\par 48. Add Capability to move fields/segs/seggroups within message tree via drag/drop
\par 49. Fixed problem where under some conditions it was not possible to add segs directly after/before a seggroup if the Add Seg dialog was already active.
\par 50. Added code to speed up Tree Expansion of all nodes
\par 51. Closed another ave
nue of note migration that occured under some circumstances when child element with notes selected, and parent (usually seg) was closed using +/- button in tree. This resulted in the child's notes being copied to the parent, and overwriting any notes that
 the parent had.
\par 52. Add data types to the list of attributes that may be changed in batch update mode.
\par 53. Left click on discrepancy log button now brings up remediation log, while right click brings up the old report log
