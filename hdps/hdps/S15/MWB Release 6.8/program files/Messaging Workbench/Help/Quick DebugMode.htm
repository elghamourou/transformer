<h1>Running the MWB in Debug Mode</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally it has been reported that the Messaging Workbench fails to
start. The most prevalent cause of this failure to date has been missing or
corrupt ODBC files. Running the MWB in debug mode allowed diagnosis of the
cause, and a work around has been developed for that particular problem.&nbsp;
If you encounter a problem in starting the MWB, run the application in debug
mode and forward the log file created to the Conformance Group representative
assisting you with the problem.</p>
<p>To run the MWB in debug mode click on the Windows <b>Start </b>button and
select <b>Run...</b></p>
<p>Use the <b>Browse</b> feature of the Run window (illustrated below) to find
the application executable <b>MsgWB.exe</b> and select it. </p>

<p>At the end of the <b>Open</b> field in the window, add<b> /d </b>after the
executable path just as shown above. Click the <b>OK</b> button to run the
application. Look for the file <b>MWBDebugLog.log</b> in the application
directory.</p>
