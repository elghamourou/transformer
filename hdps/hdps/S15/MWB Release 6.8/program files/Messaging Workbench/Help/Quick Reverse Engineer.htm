<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Reverse Engineering Specifications</b></font></p>

<p><b>These instructions are intended to get you working quickly reverse
engineering a specification. They will be most helpful if you have
taken the <a href="AppDescriptionPage.htm"> introductory tour</a> first. It is
also recommended that you first look at the instructions for <a href="Quick%20Existing%20Specification.htm">operating
with an existing specification</a>.</b></p>

<p>Start the MWB. From the <b>File</b> menu select <b>Capture External Message</b>.
This will open the <b>Message Capture tab </b>of the MWB.</p>
<p>Note the <b>Get Message File button</b>. Click it to navigate to a text file
that contains an ER7 encoded message. After selecting the file it will be
displayed in the <b>Message Text</b> display area. Alternately and probably more
practically, you may copy the ER7 message from another document onto the
clipboard, and paste it into the <b>Message Text</b> window.</p>
<p>The message may be edited within the window to correct any deficiencies or
artifacts discovered. Once the message is copied to the Message Text window, the
<b>Parse Message</b> button is enabled.</p>
<p>The outcome of clicking the <b>Parse Message button</b> is 1.) The <b>Message
Parse Tre</b>e to the right is populated, and 2.) the <b>Derived Message
Structure</b> field displays the abstract message structure for the message.
Within the Message parse tree the segments encountered in the message are
displayed sequentially with their constituent message elements labeled in HL7
shorthand hierarchically beneath them. At the lowest level of the hierarchy in
the parse tree are the values&nbsp; associated with the primitive data elements
(there will be a list of values for a repeating element). </p>
<p>Notice the <b>Consolidate Repeat Segments check box.</b> If this is checked,
the MWB will attempt to group repeating segments into appropriate segment
groups. If this is not appropriate for the particular message that you are
working with un-check the box to view and process all of the repeated segments
just as they were encountered in the message. The abstract message derived from
the captured message and displayed in the Message Structure field may be edited
before further processing (see below). This way you have an opportunity to
change or adjust the segment groupings or segment positions within the abstract
message. </p>
<p>Beneath the derived <b>Message Structure Window</b> is the <b>Derive
Specification button</b>. Click this button to derive the specification for the
abstract message structure culled from the captured message. After compilation,
the <b>Message Definition Tree</b> is automatically brought into view with the
specification parameters panel fields populated from information in the message,
and the <b>Message Tree</b> populated. The specification for the captured
message has been &quot;reverse engineered&quot; at this point. </p>
<p>Note that each of the values culled from the captured message have been
automatically associated with their Message Tree counter-parts as <b>example
values</b>. An optional feature of the Message&nbsp; Tree displays the HL7
shorthand path for each element in the tree as the mouse is swept over the
element. The paths displayed should now correspond the the node paths displayed
on the Capture tab Parse tree. This can aid in debugging errant message
examples. Also note that since pressing the <b>Derive Specification</b> button sweeping
the mouse over <b>Parse Tree </b> elements displays their corresponding element names
from the <b> Message Tree</b> which also aids in debugging.</p>
