The main SpecXML report stylesheet is MWBProfile.xsl

MWBProfileNOX.xsl renders a SpecXML report that omits message elements that have an optionality of X or NS (i.e. not supported).

MWBProfileFO.xsl renders a SpecXML report that omits element below the field level.

The primary intent of the second 2 stylesheets is to demonstrate how the standard SpecXML report may be modified by the user to meet local requirements
